# 0. Simple Web Stack

## ðŸ“Œ Infrastructure Description
This simple infrastructure hosts the website **www.foobar.com** on a single server.

- **Domain name:** `foobar.com` configured with a **www A record** pointing to `8.8.8.8`.
- **Server components:**
  - **Web server (Nginx)** â†’ handles HTTP requests, serves static content, forwards requests.
  - **Application server** â†’ executes application code (business logic).
  - **Application files (code base)** â†’ the websiteâ€™s code.
  - **Database (MySQL)** â†’ stores persistent data.

## ðŸ“Œ Components Explanation
- **What is a server?**  
  A physical or virtual machine that provides services (e.g., hosting a website) to clients.

- **Role of the domain name:**  
  Translates a human-readable address (`foobar.com`) into the server IP (`8.8.8.8`).

- **Type of DNS record (`www`):**  
  An **A record**, mapping `www.foobar.com` to the IP address of the server.

- **Role of the web server:**  
  Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

- **Role of the application server:**  
  Runs the application code and generates dynamic content.

- **Role of the database:**  
  Stores and retrieves structured data (users, posts, transactions, etc.).

- **Server communication with userâ€™s computer:**  
  Uses **HTTP/HTTPS protocols** over TCP/IP.

## ðŸ“Œ Issues with This Infrastructure
- **SPOF (Single Point of Failure):** If the server crashes, the entire site is down.  
- **Downtime during maintenance:** Any updates or restarts make the website unavailable.  
- **Scalability limits:** One server cannot handle heavy traffic loads.
