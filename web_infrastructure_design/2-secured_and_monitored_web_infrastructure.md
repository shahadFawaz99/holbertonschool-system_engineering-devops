# 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## ðŸ“Œ Infrastructure Description
This setup builds on the distributed infrastructure, but now it is **secured**, supports **HTTPS**, and is **monitored**.

- **Domain name:** `foobar.com` with a **www A record** pointing to the load balancerâ€™s IP.  
- **Load balancer (HAProxy)** with an **SSL certificate** to serve HTTPS traffic.  
- **2 servers (each containing):**
  - Web server (Nginx)
  - Application server
  - Application files (code base)
  - Database (MySQL Primary-Replica)  
- **3 Firewalls:** One protecting the load balancer, one protecting the servers, and one protecting the database.  
- **3 Monitoring clients:** Installed on each server to collect metrics and logs, sent to a monitoring system (e.g., SumoLogic).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why Adding New Elements
- **Firewalls:** Restrict unauthorized access; allow only necessary ports (80/443 for web, 3306 for DB).  
- **SSL certificate:** Encrypts traffic between the user and the website (protects sensitive data).  
- **Monitoring clients:** Provide visibility into system health, errors, usage, and QPS.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
- **Firewalls:** Block malicious traffic, enforce security rules.  
- **HTTPS with SSL/TLS:** Encrypts communication to ensure confidentiality and integrity.  
- **Monitoring:** Detects failures, bottlenecks, and anomalies. Collects logs and metrics.  
- **How monitoring collects data:** Agents/clients installed on servers send logs, metrics (CPU, RAM, QPS) to a central monitoring service.  
- **Monitoring QPS (Queries per Second):** Configure the monitoring tool to track requests served by Nginx.

## ðŸ“Œ Issues with This Infrastructure
- **SSL termination at the load balancer:**  
  Traffic between load balancer and servers is unencrypted â†’ still vulnerable inside the private network.  

- **Database write bottleneck:**  
  Only one Primary MySQL server accepts writes â†’ performance and availability risk.  

- **Servers with identical components:**  
  Each server has web, app, and DB â†’ not modular; scaling and maintenance are harder.
