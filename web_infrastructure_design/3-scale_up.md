# 3. Scale Up

## ðŸ“Œ Infrastructure Description
This infrastructure scales up the previous setup by **adding redundancy** at the load balancer level and **splitting components** into dedicated servers.

- **Domain name:** `foobar.com` with a **www A record** pointing to the load balancersâ€™ public IP.  
- **2 Load balancers (HAProxy) in cluster mode:** Provides redundancy and removes SPOF at the LB level.  
- **Dedicated servers:**
  - **Web server(s):** Nginx only.  
  - **Application server(s):** Runs the business logic/code.  
  - **Database server(s):** Primary-Replica MySQL cluster for persistence and redundancy.  
- **+1 extra server:** Added to increase capacity (could be for app tier or web tier).

## ðŸ“Œ Why Adding New Elements
- **Extra server:** Supports higher traffic and improves redundancy.  
- **Second load balancer:** Removes the load balancer SPOF, ensures failover.  
- **Splitting components:**  
  - **Web server:** Optimized for handling static files, incoming HTTP(S) traffic.  
  - **Application server:** Focused on dynamic content and logic execution.  
  - **Database server:** Dedicated to persistence and replication, optimized for queries.

## ðŸ“Œ Application Server vs Web Server
- **Web server (Nginx):**  
  - Handles client HTTP/HTTPS requests.  
  - Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).  
  - Passes dynamic requests to the application server.  

- **Application server:**  
  - Executes application logic (Python, PHP, Ruby, etc.).  
  - Communicates with the database.  
  - Returns processed results back to the web server.
